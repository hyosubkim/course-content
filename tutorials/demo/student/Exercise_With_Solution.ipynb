    "\n",
    "- Provide structure/boilerplate: let the student focus on the content\n",
    "- Objectives of the exercise should be clear\n",
    "- Don't require students to write more than 3-4 lines of code\n",
    "- Provide a runnable solution for the technical team and TAs (tag with `# to_remove`)\n",
    "- If the solution produces a plot, use XKCD mode so it looks \"cartoony\"\n",
